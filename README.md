# CMS Pods Manager

**CMS Pods** allows you to manage the hosting of websites built on WordPress,
Ghosts and other to come on VPS servers from cloud providers using Docker.

Servers are provisioned in your own account. Websites are deployed using
Docker and allows to use multiple servers for different scenarios (uses Docker
Swarm and block storage volumes).

Frontend: React + Bootstrap
Libraries: Firebase, Dockerode
Backend: Firebase Cloudstore & Cloud Functions

cloud hosters.
